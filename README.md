# Shallow Learning
This repository holds code for building shallow learning models, including linear regression and logistic regression models, from scratch.

Single_Layer_Optimizers defines shallow learning tools that I have built from scratch.  It includes derived classes for both a linear regression model and a logistic regression model.
